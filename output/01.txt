{'answer': 'Sure! Photosynthesis is the process that plants, algae, and some bacteria use to make their own food. They take in sunlight, carbon dioxide (from the air), and water, and use these to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen.\n\nHere‚Äôs how it works in simple terms:\n\n1. **Sunlight**: Plants absorb sunlight using a green pigment in their leaves called chlorophyll.\n2. **Carbon dioxide**: They take in carbon dioxide through tiny pores in their leaves called stomata.\n3. **Water**: Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots.\n\nWith the help of sunlight, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, which they use for energy and growth. Oxygen is released as a byproduct, which is important because it‚Äôs what humans and animals breathe.\n\nIn summary, photosynthesis is how plants make their food and produce oxygen, which supports life on Earth.
