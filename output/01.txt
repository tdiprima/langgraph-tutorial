{'answer': 'Photosynthesis is the process that plants, algae, and some bacteria use to make their own food. They take in sunlight, carbon dioxide (from the air), and water, and turn these into glucose (a type of sugar that provides energy) and oxygen. This happens in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll that captures sunlight.\n\nIn simple terms, photosynthesis is like a recipe where plants use sunlight as their energy source to "cook" food for themselves. At the same time, they release oxygen into the air, which is essential for humans and animals to breathe. Itâ€™s a vital process that supports life on Earth by providing energy and maintaining the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.'}
