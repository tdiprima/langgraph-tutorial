# LangGraph Tutorial for Students: Building AI Workflows

Welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial on **LangGraph**, a powerful framework for creating AI workflows! LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem and helps you build applications where multiple AI tasks (or "agents") work together, like a flowchart for smart systems. Whether you're new to coding or an experienced developer, this guide will walk you through practical examples over three weeks. We'll start with a simple app this week and build up to more complex projects.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- What LangGraph is and why it's useful.
- How to build a **Question Processor** app that answers questions, classifies them, and generates tags—all in parallel—then packages the results into a neat JSON file.
- Hands-on coding with clear steps and tests to ensure everything works.

Let's dive in!

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a tool for designing workflows where AI agents collaborate to complete tasks. Imagine it as a coordinator that manages different steps—like answering a question, tagging it, or summarizing text—and keeps everything organized. It's great for:

- **Memory**: Remembering past steps or conversations.
- **Parallel Tasks**: Running multiple processes at once to save time.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Letting you jump in to make decisions.
- **Saving Progress**: Storing work so you can pick up where you left off.

Big companies like Klarna (for customer support bots) and Uber (for generating code) use LangGraph in real-world projects, proving its value. Over the next three weeks, we'll explore three fun use cases:

1. **Week 1**: A Question Processor (this week!).
2. **Week 2**: Turning meeting transcripts into concise minutes.
3. **Week 3**: Refining the tone of your writing.

## Part 1: Building a Question Processor

This week, we'll create an app that:

- Takes a question (e.g., "What is photosynthesis?").
- Processes it in parallel to:
  - Generate an answer.
  - Classify it into a category (e.g., "science").
  - Create tags with weights (e.g., "plants: 0.9").
- Combines everything into a JSON document.

We'll break it into bite-sized sections with code, explanations, and tests.

### Setup and Prerequisites

Before we start coding, let's set up our environment:

- **Python**: You need Python 3.11 or higher installed.
- **Virtual Environment**: We'll create a dedicated environment for our project.
- **Packages**: We'll use `langgraph` and `langchain-openai`.
- **API Key**: An OpenAI API key is optional (skip it if you use a local model).

#### Create a Virtual Environment

First, let's create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python3.11 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# To deactivate the environment when you're done:
# deactivate
```

#### Set Up Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
langgraph==0.0.19
langchain-openai==0.0.2  # Contains both OpenAI and AzureOpenAI integrations
python-dotenv==1.0.1
```

Then install the packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root to store your API keys securely:

```
# Azure OpenAI API Configuration
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_here
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-05-15
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name

# Other configuration variables
# TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

(Replace `your_key_here` with your actual key from OpenAI.)

To load these environment variables in your code, you'll need to add:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # This loads the variables from .env
```

## Create a file called `question_processor.py`—this is where all our code will live

### Section 1: Define State and Nodes

First, we'll define the "state" (data that flows through our app) and "nodes" (tasks like answering or tagging). Open `question_processor.py` and add this code:

```python
from typing import Annotated, TypedDict
import os
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Define the state: what data we'll track
class State(TypedDict):
    question: str          # The input question
    answer: str = ""       # The generated answer
    category: str = ""     # The category (e.g., "science")
    tags: list = []        # List of tags with weights

# Define structured outputs using Pydantic
class Answer(BaseModel):
    answer: str = Field(description="Readable answer to the question")

class Category(BaseModel):
    category: str = Field(description="Single word category, e.g., 'science'")

class Tags(BaseModel):
    tags: list = Field(description="List of dicts with 'tag' and 'weight' (0-1)")

# Set up the language model (we're using OpenAI's GPT-4o)
llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    azure_deployment=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    openai_api_version=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION")
)

# Node to generate an answer
def answer_node(state: State):
    prompt = f"Answer this question in a readable way: {state['question']}"
    response = llm.invoke(prompt).content
    return {"answer": response}

# Node to classify the question
def classify_node(state: State):
    prompt = f"Classify this question into a single word category: {state['question']}"
    response = llm.invoke(prompt).content
    return {"category": response}

# Node to generate tags
def tag_node(state: State):
    prompt = f"Generate 4 tags for this question with weights (0-1) showing importance, in JSON format: {state['question']}"
    response = llm.invoke(prompt).content
    import json
    tags = json.loads(response)
    return {"tags": tags}
```

#### Code Explanation

- **Imports**: We bring in tools for typing (`TypedDict`), the graph framework (`StateGraph`), the OpenAI model (`ChatOpenAI`), and structured data (`BaseModel`).
- **State**: A `TypedDict` called `State` holds our data: the question, answer, category, and tags. Default values are empty so we can fill them later.
- **Pydantic Models**: These (e.g., `Answer`, `Category`) ensure our outputs are structured and easy to check.
- **Language Model**: `llm` is our AI brain, set to use OpenAI's "gpt-4o" model. You can swap this for another model if you prefer.
- **Nodes**:
  - `answer_node`: Takes the question from `state` and asks the AI for a readable answer.
  - `classify_node`: Asks for a one-word category.
  - `tag_node`: Requests four tags in JSON format, then parses them into a Python list.

#### Test It Out

Add this at the bottom of your file and run it:

```python
state = {"question": "What is photosynthesis?"}
print(answer_node(state))  # Outputs something like {"answer": "Photosynthesis is..."}
print(classify_node(state))  # Outputs {"category": "science"}
print(tag_node(state))  # Outputs {"tags": [{"tag": "plants", "weight": 0.9}, ...]}
```

Check the outputs:

- Is the answer clear and readable?
- Does the category make sense?
- Are there four tags with weights between 0 and 1?

### Section 2: Build the Graph with Parallel Execution

Now, let's connect our nodes into a graph where tasks run in parallel. Add this code to `question_processor.py`:

```python
# Create the graph
graph = StateGraph(State)

# Add nodes to the graph
graph.add_node("answer", answer_node)
graph.add_node("classify", classify_node)
graph.add_node("tag", tag_node)
graph.add_node("combine", lambda x: x)  # Temporary placeholder

# Set the starting point and parallel edges
graph.add_edge("start", "answer")
graph.add_edge("start", "classify")
graph.add_edge("start", "tag")

# Connect all nodes to "combine"
graph.add_edge("answer", "combine")
graph.add_edge("classify", "combine")
graph.add_edge("tag", "combine")

# Define entry and exit points
graph.set_entry_point("start")
graph.set_finish_point("combine")

# Compile the graph into an app
app = graph.compile()
```

#### Code Explanation

- **Graph Creation**: `StateGraph(State)` sets up our workflow using the `State` we defined.
- **Adding Nodes**: Each node (answer, classify, tag) is added with its function. The `combine` node is a placeholder for now.
- **Edges**:
  - `graph.add_edge("start", "answer")` means when the graph starts, it kicks off the `answer_node`.
  - We add edges from "start" to all three nodes, so they run at the same time (parallel execution!).
  - After finishing, each node connects to "combine" to bring the results together.
- **Entry and Finish**: "start" is where we begin, and "combine" is where we end.
- **Compile**: `app = graph.compile()` turns our graph into a runnable program.

#### Test It Out

Try this at the bottom of your file:

```python
result = app.invoke({"question": "What is photosynthesis?"})
print(result)
```

You should see a dictionary with the question, answer, category, and tags. Since `combine` is a placeholder, it just passes the state through. Check:

- Did all three tasks (answer, classify, tag) run?
- Are the results stored in `result`?

---

### Section 3: Combine Results into JSON

Let's finish by updating the `combine` node to package everything into a JSON-friendly format. Replace the placeholder `combine` node with this:

```python
# Node to combine results into a JSON-like structure
def combine_node(state: State):
    return {
        "response": {
            "question": state["question"],
            "answer": state["answer"],
            "category": state["category"],
            "tags": state["tags"]
        }
    }

# Update the graph with the new combine node
graph.add_node("combine", combine_node)
app = graph.compile()  # Recompile after updating
```

#### Code Explanation

- **Combine Node**: `combine_node` takes the `state` and builds a nested dictionary under a `"response"` key. This makes it easy to turn into JSON later.
- **Update Graph**: We overwrite the old `combine` node and recompile the app to use the new version.

#### Test It Out

Run this:

```python
result = app.invoke({"question": "What is photosynthesis?"})
import json
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

You'll get output like:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to make food.",
    "category": "science",
    "tags": [
      {"tag": "plants", "weight": 0.9},
      {"tag": "sunlight", "weight": 0.8},
      {"tag": "biology", "weight": 0.7},
      {"tag": "energy", "weight": 0.6}
    ]
  }
}
```

Check:

- Is the JSON well-formed (no errors when printing)?
- Do the answer, category, and tags match the question?

#### Final Test

Let's try multiple questions:

```python
questions = ["What is photosynthesis?", "How do rockets work?", "Tell me about history"]
for q in questions:
    result = app.invoke({"question": q})
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

Look at the outputs:

- Are the answers relevant?
- Do the categories and tags fit each question?
